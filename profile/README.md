## What is Slidepad?  

**Slidepad** is a dynamic multitasking tool that brings a browser-style experience to your Mac desktop. Designed for professionals, students, and creators, it lets you open web apps, chat clients, documents, and tools in a clean, floating window that slides in from the screen edge — always ready when you need it.  

Instead of switching between countless tabs or apps, Slidepad keeps your workflow within reach. You can pin Gmail, Notion, Slack, or any other web service and access them instantly with a swipe. Its **slide-in panel interface** minimizes distractions while maximizing productivity, combining the convenience of a browser with the feel of a native macOS utility.  

Slidepad supports **split view, drag-and-drop, and audio/video playback** directly inside its floating workspace. You can manage multiple accounts, mute tabs, and even receive notifications without leaving your current task. The app’s lightweight design ensures smooth performance, perfect for keeping reference material, research tabs, or messaging apps open alongside your main work.  

Built natively for macOS, Slidepad features **keyboard shortcuts, trackpad gestures, and dark mode** support, seamlessly blending into your desktop environment. Whether you’re managing your workflow or just want faster access to your favorite tools, Slidepad redefines multitasking on Mac.
